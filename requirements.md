Gaming Leaderboard - Take Home Assignment - SDE 1A gaming leaderboard system is a ranking mechanism used in multiplayer and competitive games to track and display player performance based on their scores, achievements, or other performance metrics. Leaderboards are a key feature in modern games, driving player engagement, competition, and motivation by allowing users to compare their performance against others.In a leaderboard system, players submit scores after playing a game, and the system dynamically updates rankings based on predefined rules, such as highest total score, recent performance, or win/loss ratios.0. Basic APIs SetupYour task is to implement APIs that allow players to submit scores, retrieve the top-ranked players, and check their own ranking.Note: Any tech stack is fine.Database StructureCREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    join_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE game_sessions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    score INT NOT NULL,
    game_mode VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE leaderboard (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    total_score INT NOT NULL,
    rank INT
);
APIs to ImplementSubmit Score (POST /api/leaderboard/submit)Accepts user_id and score.Update score in game_sessions table.Get Leaderboard (GET /api/leaderboard/top)Retrieves the top 10 players sorted by total_score.Get Player Rank (GET /api/leaderboard/rank/{user_id})Fetches the player's current rank.Now, you'll take your leaderboard system to the next level by working with millions of game records and optimizing your APIs under real-world conditions. You'll integrate New Relic for monitoring, run a load simulation script to mimic real user behavior, and work towards reducing API latencies while maintaining atomicity under concurrent requests. Additionally, you'll build a simple frontend UI with live updates to showcase how well you can work across the stack. The goal is to test your problem-solving skills, ability to handle pressure, and commitment to delivering a high-performance system.Don't just focus on solving the assignmentâ€”make sure you thoroughly understand the underlying concepts. You'll be asked detailed questions not only about your implementation but also about the various concepts and techniques used throughout the assignment.1. Setup Database with Large DatasetExecute the following SQL queries to populate the database:(Reduce the table size if these queries are taking too long to finish, meanwhile plan for the rest of the assignment & get started)-- Populate Users Table with 1 Million Records
INSERT INTO users (username)
SELECT 'user' || generate_series(1, 1000000);

-- Populate Game Sessions with Random Scores
INSERT INTO game_sessions (user_id, score, game_mode, timestamp)
SELECT
    floor(random() * 1000000 + 1)::int,
    floor(random() * 10000 + 1)::int,
    CASE WHEN random() > 0.5 THEN 'solo' ELSE 'team' END,
    NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day' * floor(random() * 365)
FROM generate_series(1, 5000000);

-- Populate Leaderboard by Aggregating Scores
INSERT INTO leaderboard (user_id, total_score, rank)
SELECT user_id, AVG(score) as total_score, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(score) DESC)
FROM game_sessions
GROUP BY user_id;
2. Simulate Real User UsageRun the following Python script to generate continuous leaderboard activity.import requests
import random
import time

API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000/api/leaderboard"

# Simulate score submission
def submit_score(user_id):
    score = random.randint(100, 10000)
    requests.post(f"{API_BASE_URL}/submit", json={"user_id": user_id, "score": score})

# Fetch top players
def get_top_players():
    response = requests.get(f"{API_BASE_URL}/top")
    return response.json()

# Fetch user rank
def get_user_rank(user_id):
    response = requests.get(f"{API_BASE_URL}/rank/{user_id}")
    return response.json()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        user_id = random.randint(1, 1000000)
        submit_score(user_id)
        print(get_top_players())
        print(get_user_rank(user_id))
        time.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 2)) # Simulate real user interaction
3. New Relic for MonitoringIntegrate New Relic (100GB free for new accounts) to monitor API performance. They should:Track API latencies under real load.Identify bottlenecks and slow database queries.Set up alerts for slow response times.4. Optimize API LatencyRefactor all 3 APIs to reduce latency. Few things to consider are:Using Database IndexingImplementing CachingOptimizing QueriesHandling ConcurrencyEnsuring data consistency5. Ensure Atomicity and ConsistencyUse transactions to handle concurrent writes without race conditions.Implement cache invalidation strategies to ensure up-to-date rankings.Guarantee that leaderboard rankings remain consistent under high traffic.6.
