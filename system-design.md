# System Design Document

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a detailed overview of the Game Leaderboard system's architecture, design choices, and implementation details. It serves as a guide for developers, outlining how different components interact and the rationale behind their design.

## 2. System Goals
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a growing number of users and game sessions without significant performance degradation.
*   **Reliability:** The system should be robust and resilient to failures, ensuring data consistency and availability.
*   **Performance:** Leaderboard data retrieval and score submission should be fast and efficient.
*   **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand and modify.
*   **Security:** User data and game scores should be protected against unauthorized access and manipulation.

## 3. Architecture Overview
The system follows a microservices-oriented architecture, with a clear separation of concerns between the backend API, database, caching layer, and frontend.

## 4. Component Deep Dive

### 4.1. Go Backend
The backend is developed in Go, chosen for its performance, concurrency features, and strong typing, making it suitable for building high-performance APIs.

#### 4.1.1. Directory Structure
```
backend/
├── cmd/
│   └── server/
│       └── main.go         // Entry point, initializes server, routes
├── internal/
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── config.go       // Configuration loading and management
│   ├── controllers/
│   │   └── leaderboard.go  // HTTP handlers for API endpoints
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── models.go       // Data structures (structs) for users, sessions, leaderboard
│   ├── repositories/
│   │   ├── game_sessions.go// Database operations for game sessions
│   │   ├── leaderboard.go  // Database operations for leaderboard
│   │   └── users.go        // Database operations for users
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── leaderboard.go  // Business logic for leaderboard operations
│   └── utils/
│       └── responses.go    // Utility functions for standardized API responses
└── pkg/
    ├── database/
    │   └── database.go     // Database connection and migration utilities
    └── redis/
        └── redis.go        // Redis client initialization and operations
```

#### 4.1.2. Key Modules and Responsibilities
*   **`cmd/server/main.go`**: Initializes the Gin HTTP router, sets up middleware, connects to PostgreSQL and Redis, and defines API routes.
*   **`internal/config`**: Handles loading configuration from environment variables or files, ensuring the application is configurable for different environments.
*   **`internal/controllers`**: Contains the HTTP handler functions. Each function is responsible for parsing incoming requests, calling the appropriate service layer method, and sending back JSON responses.
*   **`internal/models`**: Defines the Go structs that map to database tables and are used for data transfer objects (DTOs) within the application.
*   **`internal/repositories`**: Encapsulates database interaction logic. Each repository provides methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on specific database tables. They abstract the underlying database technology from the service layer.
*   **`internal/services`**: Contains the core business logic. Services orchestrate calls to repositories and other services, apply business rules, and prepare data for controllers. This layer is responsible for maintaining data consistency and integrity.
*   **`internal/utils`**: Provides common utility functions, such as standardized JSON response formatting.
*   **`pkg/database`**: Manages the PostgreSQL database connection pool and handles database migrations.
*   **`pkg/redis`**: Manages the Redis client connection and provides methods for interacting with the Redis cache.

#### 4.1.3. API Endpoints
(Detailed in `api-endpoints.md`)

### 4.2. Postgres Database
PostgreSQL is chosen for its robustness, transactional integrity, and strong support for complex queries, making it ideal for storing structured game data.

#### 4.2.1. Schema Design
(Detailed in `database-schema.md`)

#### 4.2.2. `init.sql`
The `db_docker/init.sql` script is used to initialize the PostgreSQL database with the necessary tables and potentially some initial data when the Docker container starts.

### 4.3. Redis Cache
Redis is used as an in-memory data store for caching leaderboard data. This significantly reduces the load on the PostgreSQL database and improves response times for frequently accessed leaderboard queries.

#### 4.3.1. Caching Strategy
*   **Leaderboard Caching:** The top N leaderboard entries are cached in Redis.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** The cache is updated whenever a new score is submitted or a user's total score changes, ensuring data freshness.
*   **Cache Aside Pattern:** The application first checks Redis for data. If not found (cache miss), it fetches from PostgreSQL, stores it in Redis, and then returns it.

### 4.4. Frontend (React)
The frontend is a React application, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface for displaying the leaderboard.

#### 4.4.1. Key Components
*   **`Leaderboard.jsx`**: Displays the main leaderboard table, fetching data from the backend API.
*   **`UserRank.jsx`**: (Potentially) Displays a specific user's rank and score.

#### 4.4.2. Data Flow
The React components make asynchronous API calls to the Go backend to retrieve leaderboard data.

### 4.5. Python Simulation Script
The `simulate.py` script is a utility for testing and demonstrating the system's capabilities under load. It simulates user registrations, game sessions, and score submissions.

## 5. Deployment Strategy (Docker Compose)
The entire system is containerized using Docker, and `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates the deployment of all services (Go backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, Frontend). This ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

### 5.1. `docker-compose.yml` Services
*   **`backend`**: Builds and runs the Go backend application.
*   **`db`**: Runs the PostgreSQL database, initialized with `db_docker/init.sql`.
*   **`redis`**: Runs the Redis caching server.
*   **`frontend`**: Builds and serves the React frontend application.

## 6. Future Enhancements
*   User authentication and authorization.
*   More sophisticated game modes and scoring systems.
*   Real-time leaderboard updates using WebSockets.
*   Admin panel for managing users and game data.
*   Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all components.
