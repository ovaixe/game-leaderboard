# Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for creating the first draft of the gaming leaderboard system.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup and Initial Implementation

1.  **Setup Project Structure:**
    *   Create a directory for the Go application.
    *   Create subdirectories for handlers, storage, and models.

2.  **Create `architecture.md`:**
    *   Define the High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) of the system.

3.  **Implement Database Schema:**
    *   Write the SQL script to create the `users`, `game_sessions`, and `leaderboard` tables in Postgres.

4.  **Develop Go Application:**
    *   Initialize a Go module.
    *   Set up a basic web server using the `net/http` package.
    *   Implement the following API endpoints:
        *   `POST /api/leaderboard/submit`
        *   `GET /api/leaderboard/top`
        *   `GET /api/leaderboard/rank/{user_id}`
    *   Establish a connection to the Postgres database using the `database/sql` and `pq` packages.

5.  **Create `docker-compose.yml`:**
    *   Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the Go application and Postgres database services.
    *   Configure the services to work together.

6.  **Create Simulation Script:**
    *   Create a Python script that sends requests to the API to simulate user activity.

7.  **Write `README.md`:**
    *   Provide instructions on how to build and run the project using Docker Compose.
