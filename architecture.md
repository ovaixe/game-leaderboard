# System Architecture

This document outlines the high-level design of the gaming leaderboard system.

## High-Level Design (HLD)

The system will consist of the following components:

*   **Go Backend:** A web server that exposes a RESTful API for submitting scores and retrieving leaderboard data. It handles business logic, interacts with the database, and serves API requests from the frontend and simulation script.
*   **Postgres Database:** A relational database that stores user data, game sessions, and leaderboard rankings. It serves as the persistent storage for all application data.
*   **Redis Cache:** A high-performance in-memory data store used for caching frequently accessed leaderboard data to improve response times and reduce database load.
*   **Frontend (React):** A web application that provides the user interface for displaying the leaderboard and potentially allowing user interaction (e.g., viewing their rank).
*   **Python Simulation Script:** A script that simulates user activity by sending requests to the API, useful for testing and load generation.

## Component Interactions

*   The **Frontend** communicates with the **Go Backend** via its RESTful API to fetch leaderboard data and potentially submit scores.
*   The **Python Simulation Script** also interacts with the **Go Backend**'s API to simulate game sessions and score submissions.
*   The **Go Backend** interacts with the **Postgres Database** for persistent storage of user, game session, and leaderboard data.
*   The **Go Backend** utilizes **Redis Cache** to store and retrieve frequently accessed leaderboard data, reducing direct database queries.
*   The **Postgres Database** and **Redis Cache** are managed via Docker containers for easy setup and deployment.
